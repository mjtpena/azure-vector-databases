    "## Vector Databases\n",
    "A Vector Database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors. These vectors can represent a wide range of information, such as numerical features, embeddings from text or images, and even complex data like molecular structures. They are typically powered by k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) indexes and built with algorithms like the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) and Inverted File Index (IVF) algorithms. Vector databases provide additional capabilities like data management, fault tolerance, authentication and access control, and a query engine.\n",

    "### What is Azure Cognitive Search?\n",
    "Azure Cognitive Search (formerly known as “Azure Search”) is a cloud search service that gives developers infrastructure, APIs, and tools for building a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications. It integrates with other Azure services in the form of indexers that automate data ingestion/retrieval from Azure data sources, and skillsets that incorporate consumable AI from Azure AI services."

It shows how Azure Cognitive Search can understand the intent behind a query and return results that are semantically relevant, even if they don’t exactly match the query terms.\n",

    "\n",
    "Semantic search is an information retrieval process used by modern search engines to return the most relevant search results. It focuses on the meaning behind search queries instead of the traditional keyword matching. The terminology comes from a branch of linguistics called semantics, which is concerned with the study of meaning. Semantic search is about visualizing relationships between concepts and entities (as well as relationships between related concepts and entities)."
